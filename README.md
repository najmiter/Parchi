# Parchi
A small app that let's you get rid of the paper version of the grocery list and make a shareable or for your own use list of items that you wanna buy.

It's helpful in cases when
- you don't want to keep a piece(s) of paper with you while you shop
- someone far away, who'd normally write a list on paper and send a picture of that, can share a list using a unique URL that's generated on the frontend (i mean the code is literally right here if you don't trust me, for some reason) so it's all private to you and of course, whoever you send that link to xD


### Why did I do it vanilla-ly
Making it in vanilla JavaScript just to make one understand why one needs to love React (and its frameworks) more.
